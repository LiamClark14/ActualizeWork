What  Challenges have you overcome in your life?

Adversity from injury
The ACT, went from a terrible score to a tutor
Pressure to earn a scholarship in high school

How did you get through them?

By getting on a consistent schedule in which I managed my time very responsibly and still got very few hours of sleep. By looking towards others who did more than I as inspiration to continue forward, and my staying grounded in my purpose for doing everything that I do.

What do you appreciate most about yourself?

My drive/motivation, my work ethic, my curiosity


What donâ€™t you appreciate?

My anti social behavior at times, my inability to remember things from long ago well, my ability to lose things like my keys, wallet and phone on a daily basis.

What are some times in your life where you have been uncomfortable? Anxious? Frustrated? How do you know you are feeling those things? What sensations from your body?

The passing of a close family member/friend/hero
Doing poor on a test that I studied very hard for
When an injury took me out of my senior year of football

For me it feels like my brain starts to send distress signals to the rest of my body, which responds accordingly by getting tense, red, short of breath, etc.

How do you cope?
