I started my pursuit of software development not knowing that I later pursue a career in it. My high school had a set amount AP classes that were essentially mandatory for students looking to compete for admission into a selective college, and one of those classes was AP Computer Science, which I took my senior year of high school. Immersing myself in code writing and software development enlightened me to the possibilities of what software could accomplish, not to mention how fond I found myself to be of coding at home by myself. 

I finished my senior year and along the way got accepted into Duke University, where I plan to graduate in the spring of 2023 with a degree in Computer Science. My freshman year I got credit for AP Computer Science and tested into the 200 level  Computer Science class Data Structures & Algorithms, where I started developing more advanced algorithms, got an introduction to machine learning, path optimization, and time complexity, and slowly grew fonder and fonder of computer science. Along the way I made several projects of my one, including a smash bros two player fighting game, the snake game, connect 4, etc. Going into the following semester, I made the decision to take a gap semester and pursue a coding bootcamp for a multitude of reasons. First, I was rather ahead of the curriculum and could afford to take a break and still graduate in 4 years, I wanted to gain the front end and back end skills necessary to help build my own startup with a few friends, and I wanted a more specialized experience where I didnâ€™t need to focus on other subjects. At the end of the day, all of my decisions have brought me to Actualize, where I aim to leave a much more efficient and skilled software than I was when I decided to take a break from Duke.
