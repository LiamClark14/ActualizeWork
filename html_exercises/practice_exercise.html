    <h3>Early Years</h3>
    <p>William Shakespeare was probably born on about April 23, 1564, the date that is traditionally given for his
      birth. He was John and Mary Shakespeare's oldest surviving child; their first two children, both girls, did not
      live beyond infancy. Growing up as the big brother of the family, William had three younger brothers, Gilbert,
      Richard, and Edmund, and two younger sisters: Anne, who died at seven, and Joan.

      Their father, John Shakespeare, was a leatherworker who specialized in the soft white leather used for gloves and
      similar items. A prosperous businessman, he married Mary Arden, of the prominent Arden family. John rose through
      local offices in Stratford, becoming an alderman and eventually, when William was five, the town bailiffâ€”much like
      a mayor. Not long after that, however, John Shakespeare stepped back from public life; we don't know why.</p>
